# CarCostCalculatorService

Issues in original code
1. adding tax for gas guzzlers was adding for all car types, but the code type was only for SUV and truck - Fixed
2. performance issue : unnecessary looping of options for each car type to calculate costs - Fixed


Reduced performance time from 3 s to 0 sec
